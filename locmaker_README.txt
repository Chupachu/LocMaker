Chupachu's Localization Maker for HOI IV

How to use:  Add or remove ideologies as you need and arrange placeholders however you want them.  Once you've done this, it's important to know that '|' characters are used as separators, so you will need to separate your information according to this.  Open the batch file and type in the name of your country tag separated by a '|' character, then enter the country's standard name followed by a '|' character, then enter the adjective name of your country.  Be sure not to put spaces after the | because they act as a break for your text and doing so will offset the text in-game.  An example would be this: USA|America|American.  Once you hit enter, your finished product will be printed out to a file titled output.yml.  The spacing and formatting is already done, so you don't need to worry about that.
